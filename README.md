# React + Vite

This is a finance tracker that will show you your budget for the month and will include these feature in the future:
  - Automatic budget allocator depending on income, rent, etc.
  - Show charts highlighting your usage
  - Be adaptive to know what month it is and reset the budget automatically every month

The tech stack for this project is React Native, CSS, and HTML for front-end. For the backend it will include Flask for managing charts, machine models, and data processing to databases.
